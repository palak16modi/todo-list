It is the process of stimulating people to actions to accomplish the goals. In the work goal context the psychological factors stimulating the people's behaviour can be - desire for money. success.

            1. Every great accomplishment in life is traceable to certain nuggets that make things work. It is the application of these nuggets that determine one’s success in life.


2. Nobody is luckier than the other, it’s the secrets each one is trading with that makes things happen. The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you!

3. Unrestrained behaviour leads eventually to destruction. People who have no vision also have no goal or purpose-nothing to shoot for. They have no direction and nowhere to go in life and, therefore they go nowhere.

4. We must learn to set a goal or target in front of our eyes to gaze upon. It is only when we aim at something that we have any chance of hitting it.

5. Vision is the power that sustains. Whatever we keep in front of our eyes is what will determine our outcome!
6. Each one of us creates an atmosphere, a reality around us, but we can only. reproduce on the outside that which is on the inside!

7. My internal reality often defines the nature of my external reality, if I prosper in my heart, my life will prosper!
8. Successful people know that success is not a gamble or a matter of chance, they know that all success comes from hard work.

9. Real success is a lifetime of learning, successful people have conditioned themselves to learn from others and from their failures and successes, they learn by practising what they know on a daily basis

10. Successful people know that true education is what you get for yourself and by yourself, it’s not what someone gives or tells you, they know that true success in life does not come by luck, a lucky man is not a successful man, true winners know that they must develop skills and acquire knowledge before becoming truly successful.
11. A successful man is one who has the knowledge, skills, and expertise that brought him to success, work your way to success, and don’t expect it to come by accident.

12. Like a person who has gained mastery over their craft, you must gain mastery over your life, take your life out of neutral, no one can make this commitment for you, intentionally pursue your own God-given purpose and maximize your own divine potential, intentionally get rid of self-defeating habits and undermining relationships.

13. Being different doesn’t imply inferior or superior to others, especially inferior, don’t confuse being different with being lesser, different simply means different. A woman is not less than a man because she is a woman, a man is not more than a woman because he is a man, their differences are necessary because of their purposes.

14. Each man is as low or high, as little or great, as base or noble, as his thoughts, no more, no less, each moves within the sphere of his own thoughts, and that sphere is his world, in that world in which he forms his habits of thoughts, he finds his company.

15. The poor man who is to become rich must begin at the bottom, and must not wish, nor try to appear affluent by attempting something far beyond his means.
